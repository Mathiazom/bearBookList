# bearBookList 🐼📚 

Simple Flask server to generate a markdown representation of a list of books.
1. Books are defined as Adlibris URL stubs at https://foxtrot.bearblog.dev/bearbookslist/
2. Book data is extracted from individual Adlibris pages (`https://www.adlibris.com/no/bok/` + book stub)
3. Markdown representation is generated from the data
